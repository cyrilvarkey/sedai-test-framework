## Best Practices from Pytest-with-Eric

### PyTest Markers
Based on the [pytest-markers-example](https://github.com/Pytest-with-Eric/pytest-markers-example) repository:
- Use built-in markers like `@pytest.mark.skip`, `@pytest.mark.skipif`, and `@pytest.mark.xfail` for test control
- Create custom markers for categorizing tests (e.g., `@pytest.mark.aws`, `@pytest.mark.azure`)
- Register custom markers in pytest.ini to avoid warnings
- Use markers for selective test execution

### Fixture Scopes
Based on the [pytest-fixture-scope-example](https://github.com/Pytest-with-Eric/pytest-fixture-scope-example) repository:
- Use appropriate fixture scopes (function, class, module, session) to optimize resource usage
- Implement session-scoped fixtures for expensive resources like cloud connections
- Use function-scoped fixtures for isolated test cases
- Implement fixture factories for dynamic fixture creation

### Mocking
Based on the [pytest-mock-example](https://github.com/Pytest-with-Eric/pytest-mock-example) repository:
- Use pytest-mock for simplified mocking
- Implement mock factories for common cloud resources
- Use patch decorators for targeted mocking
- Implement spy objects for verification
- Create realistic mock responses for cloud APIs

### Async Testing
Based on the [pytest-asyncio-example](https://github.com/Pytest-with-Eric/pytest-asyncio-example) repository:
- Use pytest-asyncio for testing asynchronous code
- Implement async fixtures for resource management
- Support concurrent API calls to cloud services
- Handle timeouts and retries for async operations

### Database Testing
Based on the [pytest-db-testing-example](https://github.com/Pytest-with-Eric/pytest-db-testing-example) repository:
- Use SQLModel for database interactions
- Implement database fixtures with transaction rollback
- Support multiple database backends
- Implement database migration testing

### CI/CD Integration
Based on the [pytest-github-actions article](https://pytest-with-eric.com/integrations/pytest-github-actions/):
- Use GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Implement matrix testing for multiple Python versions and environments
- Cache dependencies for faster builds
- Upload test results as artifacts
- Implement status badges for repositories

## Architecture Considerations

### Modular Design
- Core framework with pluggable providers
- Separation of concerns between test infrastructure and test cases
- Dependency injection for service clients
- Factory pattern for provider instantiation
- Strategy pattern for provider-specific implementations

### Security
- Credential isolation between tests
- Secure storage of sensitive information
- Just-in-time credential access
- Principle of least privilege for test accounts
- Audit logging for credential usage

### Scalability
- Parallel test execution
- Resource pooling for shared resources
- Lazy initialization of expensive resources
- Cleanup of resources after tests
- Timeout handling for long-running operations

### Maintainability
- Consistent coding style (PEP8)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Self-documenting code
- Separation of test data from test logic
- Reusable test fixtures and utilities

## Next Steps
1. Design secure authentication management system
2. Design provider library integration architecture
3. Implement PyTest markers, ordering, and parallelization
4. Integrate Kubernetes support
5. Implement external reporting
6. Develop CI/CD pipeline
7. Create framework presentation and documentation
