# Comprehensive Project Plan: Test Automation Framework for Sedai

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for designing a PyTest framework to automate cloud services including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and various monitoring providers. The framework will follow PEP8 standards, implement design patterns, and maintain a proper folder structure in a pythonic way using the latest version of pip packages.
